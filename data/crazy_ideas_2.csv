bubbleblowingbabie,t3_bnryz0,3,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bnryz0/there_should_be_a_website_that_eases_young_people/,2,"I know many people scarred by what they saw in their first porn searches as kids. And I have heard horror stories of people's parents being suspected of pedophilia after the countless searches for ""little girl boobs"". Important things I would include in this site:

* How to clear history and private browsing
* A warning about CP being illegal and why, and what to search instead (schoolgirl, barely legal, teen)
* An explanation of paid versus free pornographic content, a warning about ads, and potential computer viruses
* A disclaimer that sex in real life is often not the same as the scripted and airbrushed world of pornography
* Recommendations for various free sites with brief descriptions of what can be found there  
* An urban dict of sorts explaining fetishes and words like yaoi and hentai
* I would include a warning about the darkweb, however that may backfire and is more difficult to get to than the average weird fetish; so maybe not the best idea. 

What would you include? Is there anything sort of like this I don't know about? 

To be clear, this isn't meant to be a magnet for kids to start looking into porn, but only a buffer to spare young people from being thrown right out into the world of pornography. A teenager might know a lot of these things already, especially if they already have good sex ed in school and education from their parents, but this isn't a reality for many people. Many young people get their entire education from media and the internet. Also many people are seeing their first porn very young, some before even hitting puberty.

ohiodylan,t3_bnesu4,9,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bnesu4/create_a_continuous_international_road_and/,3,"North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia should all be connected into one giant roadway/railway. Make the railroad 2 rails for each direction continuously welded together with concrete rail ties. Make the roadway out of asphalt or any paving material practical for the region (most economical by the year, no low quality materials but instead mid quality). The road way should have 4 lanes total with 2 lanes going opposite directions of the other 2 lanes divided from the opposing 2 lanes. (Like an avenue/basic highway with a gap median. The railroad should be in the median of this highway. So the road would be international and all cars MUST drive on the right. The International Highway And Railroad (I.H.R Network) would be 2 road lanes going one way with two rail lines in the middle elevated by earth/concrete (to prevent an off road car hitting a train) followed by 2 road lanes going the opposite direction. So a 4 lane divided highway with railroad tracks in between. The rail gauge would be 4ft 8 and 1/2 inches (international standard gauge).

The road signs/train stations would have 8 major languages

-English
-Spanish
-Chinese
-Hindu
-Arabic
-French
-German
-Russian

For safety, the road signs would be divided up into one-two languages per sign to prevent confusion. The order of these signs would depend on the region (in russia russian would be the first sign posted in, in the USA, English/Spanish are the first languages for the road signs).

The trains wouldn’t be ultra high speed rail but the railroad would be reasonably fast (160+ mph/ 250+ kph) and powered by electricity.

The IHR Network would require at least one gas station every 60 miles (100 km)  that’s well visibly posted.

The speed limit for cars on this road would depend on the region, in areas with heavy ice/road hazards that speed limit would be 70mph (120 kph) 

In an area that’s rural, safe, and clear, the speed limit would be 100 mph (160 kph).

All cars/trains on the IHR would have to pay a $500 and inflation adjusted refundable bond that they’ll return to their home country/comply with immigration/laws on these closed circuit highways. Failure to comply with international immigration/law will result in the $500 going to the host country. 

Additional immigration laws would fall in place for those exiting these national zones with little immigration law. (Example, have towns where within 6 miles (10 kilometers from the station/highway exit is a free zone for visitors visas with strong immigration checkpoints at the border of these zones (like an airport). 

To drive your car on these roads, you would have to pay a $0.03/mile toll for sedans/small trucks under 6,000 pounds (3000kg)  for helping with maintenance. Semi trucks would have to pay $0.08/mile for using this road. Cars would need an international license plate on the front and back windshield with RFID technology/AI/Facial recognition technology/biometric. All drivers must be 18 years old to use the road with 2 years of driving experience and a maximum of 2 at fault accidents. This road also requires specialty car insurance for this road for international driving from a Solvent insurance company. The car would need to be insurance for up to $50,000 in damages minimum. An international driver’s permit is also required.  Criminal/terrorist background check is required and will bar violent/dangerous offenders from using this road for international use unless the country overrides their ban within their borders only. The car would also need to be registered with a valid VIN number and pass safety inspection (the vehicle must be functional and able to reach a minimum of 80 mph on the road). 

The train would also let you travel and the ticket to travel by train would be $0.08 a mile. The money would be distributed based on how many passenger miles the country has and an international fund would maintain the system in poorer countries.

Australia would connect to islands/Asia mainland. Europe would go through Russia, Mongolia, China, India, Nepal, ( avoid the middle east),  Africa would connect Morocco to Spain then travel down the western coast of Africa. The road would travel over the coast line if the country’s too dangerous with an international militia down, the route goes to south africa. 

The bering strait connects russia with north america with a route that goes down through latin america through south america through panama but off the coast for rainforest conservation. In the mountains the route crosses through southern Columbia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay.

Feynstein1,t3_bmqwfi,9,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bmqwfi/attempting_to_construct_an_orbital_ring_would/,11,"So I've been doing some digging as to why space travel is so expensive and as far as I've been been able to tell, it mainly boils down to two things: a) space travel is incredibly risky and specialized and hence rare b) the shuttles can't be reused (for the most part). I know SpaceX is working on reason b) but I think we can do better. In economics, we can utilize the economies of scale to produce something in large quantities and drive down costs drastically. In our case, if shuttle launches were happening on a regular basis, say every month or every two weeks, with the same payload, we'd be able to utilize economies of scale to drive down costs. But what would we do with all those launches? We'd use it to transport material into orbit and construct an orbital ring around earth. Isaac Arthur has done a great video on it, here's a link to it: https : // www . youtube . com / watch ? v = LMbI6sk-62E. The orbital ring is a great infrastructure because unlike the space elevator, it is feasible with current technology and we can even build an elevator descending from it, which would greatly reduce the cost of space travel. But that's not my idea. My idea is that simply by attempting to construct the orbital ring, space travel will become far cheaper than it is today. And once the ring is complete, it would become cheaper still. So we're basically making space travel its own purpose. Now I know any government probably wouldn't do this for political reasons. But if we could gather private investors and convince them that they would get plenty of return on investment, this could happen. It seems like the next logical step for our civilization to me. Once the ring is complete, space travel will become much cheaper and fairly routine. Then we can easily travel to Mars and pretty much anywhere in the solar system.",False,CrazyIdeas,Attempting to construct an orbital ring would make space travel much cheaper right now,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bmqwfi/attempting_to_construct_an_orbital_ring_would/

I used to play a bit of a wicked game with my MIL and never told my wife until after her mother had died. My MIL and me did not get along and found lots of ways to hurl insults at each other.

My MIL was very thin and was sensitive to temperature. I knew I could use this as a weakness. Shortly before inviting my MIL to my house, I would turn down the thermostat a few degrees in Winter, just to make it uncomfortable but not noticeably bad to a normal padded person, so my wife would not notice it.

After about an hour at my house my MIL would start whining about being cold. I would ignore her and pretend I hadn't heard. Eventually, when there was just me and her in the room, I knew I had my opportunity, she whined one more time and then I said, ""if you whine one more time, I will turn it down further"". That shut her up.

I would also play the reverse game in summer and not have enough A/C on, so the house was too hot.

To make this particularly effective I would also try to invite my MIL over at the coldest and hottest days of the year, just to make the punishment particularly effective.

The advantage to Thermostat Torture is it makes your MIL's visit a brief one.

I had an idea to put anti-gun zones at schools similarly how a school might block cellular data signals so kids can't use their phones in class or invisible shock fences for dogs on the lawn. 



How it would work: schools would have an invisible barrier (signal maybe?) that would make all guns in it's coverage unable to be fired. Only authorized people would be able to fire any (security guard/police etc). 



While in the area any gun would be forced into safety mode and would be unable to fire via this signal



In the near future, the government would do an even exchange for these high tech guns with the automatic safety technology. Not sure if they would be completely new guns or just permanent modifications to existing guns. 



The problems: 
This solution would take several decades to become effective. The problem is the same as with self-driving cars and high speed highways: those owning outdated versions of these items would be able to bypass the futuristic features. 



This means that anyone holding on to old guns or maybe purchasing them illegally would be able to bypass these security features and harm students. 



Another issue is the danger of the government putting locks on guns which would potentially put down citizen revolts (second amendment violation). Also allows for corruption or unbalanced control of law enforcement potentially if abused.

We waste way too much and I think being removed from the butchering process is part of the reason. 

I think that eating meat is nothing to be ashamed of but I also think that society has glorified the “manliness” of eating meat when many people do not actually kill or process their own food.

See, one of the current theories on universe death is that once all the stars die, the majority of the  universe will be black holes. These eventually evaporate and could also explode and release everything from inside them. The theroy goes on to say that all the matter will eventually break down, until it is all gone. 

Now this is where my twist on it comes in what if most, if not all, of the black holes consolidated. The black hole they made was the largest ever, with almost all of the matter in the univere, and then it exploded, and released all its matter. All the matter set in motion by the boom goes in the right places, and boom, universe made.

This has been on my mind for quite a while now and since I don't have the expertise to make this a reality, I'll do the next best thing! 

post it on reddit.

So, as you could have probably guess,

 I'm ""trying"" to combine the convoluted mass that is KingdomHearts with the complexity that is Undertale.

 Now, you are probably wondering,""How ever are you going to do that? They are nothing alike, one is an action JRPG while the other is a bullet-hell RPG/Dating Sim (sorta)! What are you, insane!"" (why yes...yes I am.)

KingdomTale:

❤ Features a spiky-haired protagonist; his name is Sora.
( i always wanted to play as anime boi #358/2)

❤ Also featuring -_-

❤ Stats! You wanna do a strength build? Magic? Or how about good ol' Defense? The choice is yours!

❤ Will center on KingdomHearts gameplay mechanics but with an Undertale setting. 
(jeez, that's helpful)

❤ 3D rendered models! (you can now date a skeleton in three dimensions!)

❤ 'Enemies' will have TWO gauges. One for Health Points and the other for what I like to call; Pacifism Drive.
       💙 Depleting the HP gauge will slay the monster. (...now why would you do that?)
       💙 Building the Pacifism Drive will pacify them.
(yay.)

❤ What DRIVEs you? (...nachos.)
       💙 Saving one of the lost souls will reward you with a Drive.
       💙 Grant's temporary stat boosts as well as other cool tricks!
       💙 Makes you look snazzy!

❤ Magic is used differently; now it's used to stun enemies. Pay attention to their patterns and Wham! Its also a main factor to Pacifism Drive build-up.

❤ Sidequests?!?

❤ Different keyblades are unlocked after certain requirements are met! (what's with the ambiguity?)

❤ Puzzles!

❤ And a lot of dogs! (...don't know why though.)

Story ('cause why not): After battling with his own troubles, the young keyblade wielder is called upon a world that has more to it than meets the eye. Befriending frogs, skeletons, some tall goat lady, and others, Sora will have to give it his all in order to free the monsters of the underground from it's terrible curse. Or else be corrupted by an unknown threat to crave the need of EXP. And lots and lots of LoVe.

So I was thinking of a real time chat service where you could make a post and instantly start a chat with a group of people interested in the topic. Unlike forums you can get instant replies on your post and it will also be more like a discussion. Putting aside all the complexity involved in actually creating something like this, would you want to spend time having discussion about stuff you are interested in with random strangers on the internet?


Can this be a good real time chat service?

It sounds stupid, but I think the main reason we are depressed is due to the fact that we compare ourselves everyday to supposedly 'better' people. If we could know everyone's flaws, then we wouldn't be seeing them as a 'perfect' human being. So we wouldn't be ashamed of our failures, because others have them too, and we wouldn't be having unrealistic standards for live. People would also stop looking down on others, because their failures are visible as well, it will bring mutual respect for the person or even genuine compassion. I don't know how we're going to do this, but I think less privacy on the internet would be, ironically, better. If we can just see the bad sides of someones life aswell, it would be beneficial in my opinion.

Ofcourse I have not covered all the flaws in this idea, since it's a problem too big for me to solve myself. The concept is what matters, the practical stuff comes later.

\[Further explanation\]

The unpopularopinion memes, websites, section and even the subreddit here is such a farce that always end up with obvious popular opinions been voted in mass while majority of voters think they are unpopular, when is clearly the opposite

And some things are even weekly brought to the top with 2k+ points each time

All this fake unpopular things end up just an echo chamber for a brainless bandwagon train that pushes on top the most popular things

**A true unpopular-opinion subreddit** should automatically freeze/shame a post and the users that upvoted it after reaches a certain amount of points/upvotes and build a karma bandwagon to tag all users that upvoted such obvious popular opinions, with no excuse given

&amp;#x200B;

Basically a mix system of how Black Mirror episodes of Nosedive and Hated in the Nation how ppl are exposed

And tag/expose users that bandwagon up vote popular opinions

The subreddit itself [https://np.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/](https://np.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/)  haves a similar rating tracking involved next to the user name(open a post and look at stars)

Then there are already bots in some subreddits that also auto tag users based on their post/comment history

The system is there but it seems ppl just prefer to keep the fake facade up there instead of doing a true social change/evolution to the current complacency

&amp;#x200B;

PS: just to give people a taste of current ""unpopular"" opinions i seen, here is the basic message in some top posts from last days.

""I like to be adult""

""Keep your kids silent in cinema""

""Emotion can influence your objective thought""

""GMO are ok""

""I like having adblock active""

etc..Just browse the subreddit by top and put an interval of time and will understand

Half of them even got gold and are on 10k+ points..

If people dont see the absurdity of that i dont know how else to explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

BIGDADDYBANDIT,t3_bkqq7x,2,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bkqq7x/reinstitute_article_xi_of_the_articles_of/,3,"So a crazy google rabbit whole lead to me learning that there are actual modern secessionist movements in Canada outside of Quebec and being a bit of a history nerd that reminded me of a clause in the now defunct Articles of Confederation (basically our rough draft of the Constitution) that reads:

*Canada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this union: but no other colony shall be admitted into the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine states.*


Now a few points and potential ramifications. I don't necessarily want Canada to break up and I know there is zero political will for something like this (otherwise I would be posting this somewhere else). But I am generally a proponent of local rule and letting the provinces that are not favored by the federal government have a political ""parachute"" in the form of guaranteed statehood would do much to give the more marginalized provinces leverage. Since Canada's supreme court ruled that secession is legal, so long as it is not unilateral and the result of a free and fair referendum, on paper it could work. I believe whatever was negotiated, it would probably end up before the Canadian supreme court, but the right of self-determination in this regard does seem to have been established.


I think new states would do much to shake up the political order in Washington, as the Canadian and American political spectrums do not cleanly line up and long term I think that is a good thing. Reconciling political and institutional differences would like have to include some devolution of powers from the federal government back to the states which would be good for all parties involved.


Economically the benefits would be manifest as trade barriers are completely eliminated and labor and capital are able to freely flow. I think a couple of provinces leaving would reduce the economic viability of the whole of Canada enough that most of if not all of the provinces join in time. One point of conflict I could think of is the economic concerns of Alberta having friction against the ecological concerns of British Columbia and without having to negotiate as two foreign powers Alberta could connect its natural gas from the shale fields to the U.S.'s network which is already the largest in the world (not to mention we have the largest petrochemical industry tooled for processing natural gas).


As for losing sovereignty, the solution I'd see that makes  the most sense is strengthening states rights to account for the wider range of differences in systems and cultures. I know for a fact that there are already states in the union far more politically and culturally different from my own than some of the provinces. There really isn't a clean cultural break along our border and while there may be differences in our identities on average, we are much more alike than we are different.",False,CrazyIdeas,Re-Institute Article XI of the Articles of Confederation (U.S.) and Allow Canadian Provinces to Freely Join the Union.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bkqq7x/reinstitute_article_xi_of_the_articles_of/

Raunchy_Potato,t3_bkar8c,42,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bkar8c/a_citizen_exchange_program_that_takes_people/,24,"The idea would be pretty simple.  Communists/socialists living in first-world countries can sign up to be a part of the exchange program.  We contact socialist/communist governments and suggest that, instead of murdering dissidents and herding them into mass graves, they simply trade them for one of our citizens.  The communist/socialist country gets to look good because people from first-world countries want to live there, and they get to get rid of dissidents at the same time.  It's a win-win for them.

Once they agree, and a citizen from their country indicates their desire to trade places, the exchange would take place.  The person from the first-would country would surrender their bank accounts, their property, their car, and their possessions.  All of those things will be given to the new immigrant when they get here.  After all, all of those things are capitalist, and if they want to live under socialism/communism properly, they can't take that stuff with them.  But the incoming immigrant will be absolutely ecstatic to start off with some money and stuff.

We drop our citizen off at the airport in whatever country they've agreed to go to, have them renounce their citizenship (so they can't change their minds later), pick up the new immigrant, and head home.  That new immigrant gets everything the former citizen left behind, and are free to use it however they want to start their new life.  They're given a fast-track to citizenship, and we could even find a way to get companies to pledge to give jobs to immigrants who come here using this system.

This would result in socialists/communists living in socialist/communist countries, and capitalists living in capitalist countries.  There do not even have to be any limits on it whatsoever, since both countries would end up with the exact same number of inhabitants at the end of the process.  This would enable thousands more people living in these impoverished countries to make it to the first world than ever before, since they now have a whole new process they can use to immigrate.  And it's completely voluntary for all parties.",False,CrazyIdeas,A citizen exchange program that takes people living under socialism/communism &amp; lets them trade places with socialists/communists in the first world who want to live under socialism/communism,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bkar8c/a_citizen_exchange_program_that_takes_people/

This money is coming from all the patrons who vote the winner from the subreddit's top 10 monthly posts.  
As a patron(we need those too but by the end of the month I'll raise a few bucks to donate myself so that the project can get a kickstart) there is no limit to how much you can pledge. All the money will be donated to the winner. Right now if you pledge you will get the access to a private discord server invite where the final voting process takes place, and where we can keep up and discuss the entries.

zaiker,t3_bjkh7h,2,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bjkh7h/sonics_design_in_the_new_movie_is_terrible_on/,12,"   Sonic's new movie has made a bit of a turmoil in the internet community. Many people hate it. They hate everything about it. They hate Sonic's look, down to the fact that he has two eyes instead of one giant eyeball with two pupils (Really? That one is more realistic?). They hate everything about Dr. Robitnik (except for that clip in the end, he looked good there). They hate that military is involved, how so many video game movies take place in the real world as opposed to their own individual ones, and so on and so on.

   The point being, the Internet now hates Sonic as a character, because the thing we learned the most about the movie, is that we hate everything about Sonic. So how does *this* become a plot twist? 

THEORY BELOW/POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD

&gt;!Because you want Sonic dead. You want Sonic to die. You want him to fail. You want Robotnik to be the victor. But Sonic wins. Of course he wins. He destroys Dr. Robotnik's factory, the Doctor loses everything, Sonic is hailed as champion, blah blah blah, fade to black.!&lt;

&gt;!But wait. It's only been around 50 minutes in. We're only halfway through. What? How? Suddenly, we're back to the scene where Dr. Robotnik has Sonic surrounded on the building, presumably the final combat of that arc. Why this scene in particular? Because Dr. Robotnik is actually present for this combat, and wearing a rather interesting pair of goggles. Those goggles are also present in his wardrobe change at the end of the trailer. What if he were to crash sometime during this fight? What if there was a large fire, and a major portion of his unprotected face were to become burned and deformed? What if this fire completely burned his hair off, and frizzled his moustache? What if this was all a flashback, explaining Dr. Eggman's back story, and now both us the viewer and the character we're following have the same desires: to see Sonic destroyed. That's right: we are now following Dr. Eggman's story, and his quest for revenge. And we want him to win. He is now the protagonist, he looks like he should, and this movie is suddenly amazing.!&lt;",False,CrazyIdeas,"Sonic's design in the new movie is terrible on purpose, and will be the making of a great plot twist.

limbodog,t3_bj6ry8,2,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bj6ry8/every_state_in_the_usa_should_set_up_a_factory_to/,5,"Fact: Drug patents last 20 years.

Fact: It can take 8 years for a drug to reach the market

That least 12 years during which a drug can be exclusively made by the holder of the patent.  After that, anyone can legally make the drug.

Almost all the drugs you see memes about where they complain about the price are no longer exclusive via patent.  Insulin costing $5,705 per year in the USA?  That's unjustifiable.  [Per BMJ, it may be possible to make effective insulin for as little as $72 per \*year\* per patient.](https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/5/e000850)   Even if we only got it down to $150/year/patient that'd be cheap enough to cover for free on any insurance policy.

Fact: Evergreening of drugs is a common occurrence - wherein a company makes a minor alteration to an existing drug that has an expiring patent to thereby grant a new 20 year patent, even if the new drug offers little to no health benefit over the old one (e.g. by adding a tiny amount of aspirin to it).

The invention of novel drugs that actually change the game is uncommon.  While there are cases where people do not get as much benefit from some generics as they do from the most recent patented drug, the majority could cost vastly less to medicate by using generics - and that number could go down even more if the state owned the manufacturer and supplied those drugs to its people as a non-profit citizen benefit.

Fact: not all expired patents create generic drugs.  Some medicines treat rare diseases and conditions.  If the market is too small, the generic manufacturers (which are sometimes the same company that makes the name brand drug) won't bother to produce it.  Capitalism doesn't support tiny markets well.  But a social program designed to benefit the populace could do so.   Deflazacort, for example, was too expensive to make when there's only about 15,000 patients in the USA.  So the US made an incentive by granting one company exclusive rights to make it and set a price of $89k/year for the drug.  Far better would be for the taxpayer to foot the bill of making that drug.  It is no longer patented.

When people talk about how expensive their health caare is in the USA, this is one of the major factors: drug prices.  The left likes to blame health insurance companies, but they don't make the drugs.  

I believe this crazy idea, which could be passed at the state level rather than having to go through Trump/Mitch, would be easier to pass than something like M4A,and  would let states dramatically lower the cost of health care for their people, whether they are insured or not, whether they are poor or not.  It would help everyone equally, and the cost would be easily borne by entities as big as US states.",False,CrazyIdeas,Every state in the USA should set up a factory to manufacture generic drugs at cost for their population,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bj6ry8/every_state_in_the_usa_should_set_up_a_factory_to/

Procedure:

Have politicians wear uniforms once every quarter.
