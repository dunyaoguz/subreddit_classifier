RamsesThePigeon,t3_bg71oh,69,/r/Showerthoughts/comments/bg71oh/your_essential_guide_to_showerthoughts/,855,"The human brain is a decidedly odd machine, often prone to glitches, malfunctions, and internal errors (like inexplicably deciding that raisins are an acceptable addition to cookies). However, within the confines of that chaos, something intriguing occasionally occurs: A seemingly mundane detail about the world will suddenly become more interesting, having been viewed from a slightly different perspective than usual.

This sort of miniature epiphany is called a showerthought.

If you’ve ever realized that “Wet Paint” signs probably cause more stained fingertips than wet paint does on its own, you’ve had a showerthought. If you’ve ever noticed that human hair is technically a renewable resource, you’ve had a showerthought. These sorts of musings tend to arise while a person’s mind is engaged with a routine, uncomplicated activity (like commuting, mowing the lawn, or waiting for a customer service representative to finally answer their allegedly important telephone call), and while the word “showerthought” may be a bit misleading – showerthoughts don’t have to occur in the shower, after all – the concept it embodies is something which everyone has experienced.

------

/r/Showerthoughts is a repository for showerthoughts; a place to share, discuss, and debate those sudden flashes of simple satori. In order to make the community as welcoming an environment as possible, we’ve put together some resources for potential submitters.

[The Overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/overview) will give you an idea of what a showerthought actually is.

[The FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq) will (hopefully) answer most enquires you’d have about the subreddit. 

[The Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) will offer some guidelines on what should and should not be posted here.

[Google](http://www.google.com) will help you determine if your thought is original and unique.

RamsesThePigeon,t3_bg71oh,69,/r/Showerthoughts/comments/bg71oh/your_essential_guide_to_showerthoughts/,849,"The human brain is a decidedly odd machine, often prone to glitches, malfunctions, and internal errors (like inexplicably deciding that raisins are an acceptable addition to cookies). However, within the confines of that chaos, something intriguing occasionally occurs: A seemingly mundane detail about the world will suddenly become more interesting, having been viewed from a slightly different perspective than usual.

This sort of miniature epiphany is called a showerthought.

If you’ve ever realized that “Wet Paint” signs probably cause more stained fingertips than wet paint does on its own, you’ve had a showerthought. If you’ve ever noticed that human hair is technically a renewable resource, you’ve had a showerthought. These sorts of musings tend to arise while a person’s mind is engaged with a routine, uncomplicated activity (like commuting, mowing the lawn, or waiting for a customer service representative to finally answer their allegedly important telephone call), and while the word “showerthought” may be a bit misleading – showerthoughts don’t have to occur in the shower, after all – the concept it embodies is something which everyone has experienced.

/r/Showerthoughts is a repository for showerthoughts; a place to share, discuss, and debate those sudden flashes of simple satori. In order to make the community as welcoming an environment as possible, we’ve put together some resources for potential submitters.

[The Overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/overview) will give you an idea of what a showerthought actually is.

[The FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq) will (hopefully) answer most enquires you’d have about the subreddit. 

[The Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) will offer some guidelines on what should and should not be posted here.

[Google](http://www.google.com) will help you determine if your thought is original and unique.
