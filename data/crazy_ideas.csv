Some of you may not see it, because we often catch submits before they gain traction. And sometimes the ""borderline"" ones are allowed to slip through if the commentary isn't out of control. 

The rules on politics will be more heavily enforced, **repeat Rule 4 and Rule 6 offenders are going to start getting bans**. This goes for both sides! 90% of Reddit is a politics circlejerk, you can get your fix for that somewhere else. ",True,CrazyIdeas,"Folks, be sure to read the sidebar.

2,LogicalOptimist,t3_blqytz,85,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/blqytz/when_your_online_order_is_a_few_dollars_short_of/,2795,"Often I find myself a few dollars short of free shipping with nothing else I want to add to my cart. Sometimes I waste a ton of time attemping to find anything I could deem useful and many of these times I just abandoned an order because of it. What if instead when you found yourself short of the free shipping mark you could donate the rest to charity. Sure the companys might make a little less on individual orders occasionally but I can say from my personal experience those orders may have never been placed to begin with.

(Edit) As a daily reddit lurker I have to say I'm absolutely blown away at how much traction one of my posts received. I understand company's have shipping costs and profit margins to maintain so definitely not expecting anyone with corporate influence to get behind this crazy idea.    It's up to the average person like us to make the world better no matter how small of a contribution. It would be nice if it were easier to do so throughout the course of our normal day. A user mentioned change roundups at some places that let you donate your change to the nearest dollar. I hope those places let you pick where you donate as some nonprofits have ridiculously overpaid ceo's and overly extravagant office spaces and that can't be the answer. I'm just a blue collar worker with poor grammer skills and to much faith in society so take my thoughts with a grain of salt I suppose.

This has been on my mind for quite a while now and since I don't have the expertise to make this a reality, I'll do the next best thing! 

post it on reddit.

So, as you could have probably guess,

 I'm ""trying"" to combine the convoluted mass that is KingdomHearts with the complexity that is Undertale.

 Now, you are probably wondering,""How ever are you going to do that? They are nothing alike, one is an action JRPG while the other is a bullet-hell RPG/Dating Sim (sorta)! What are you, insane!"" (why yes...yes I am.)

KingdomTale:

❤ Features a spiky-haired protagonist; his name is Sora.
( i always wanted to play as anime boi #358/2)

❤ Also featuring -_-

❤ Stats! You wanna do a strength build? Magic? Or how about good ol' Defense? The choice is yours!

❤ Will center on KingdomHearts gameplay mechanics but with an Undertale setting. 
(jeez, that's helpful)

❤ 3D rendered models! (you can now date a skeleton in three dimensions!)

❤ 'Enemies' will have TWO gauges. One for Health Points and the other for what I like to call; Pacifism Drive.
       💙 Depleting the HP gauge will slay the monster. (...now why would you do that?)
       💙 Building the Pacifism Drive will pacify them.
(yay.)

❤ What DRIVEs you? (...nachos.)
       💙 Saving one of the lost souls will reward you with a Drive.
       💙 Grant's temporary stat boosts as well as other cool tricks!
       💙 Makes you look snazzy!

❤ Magic is used differently; now it's used to stun enemies. Pay attention to their patterns and Wham! Its also a main factor to Pacifism Drive build-up.

❤ Sidequests?!?

❤ Different keyblades are unlocked after certain requirements are met! (what's with the ambiguity?)

❤ Puzzles!

❤ And a lot of dogs! (...don't know why though.)

Story ('cause why not): After battling with his own troubles, the young keyblade wielder is called upon a world that has more to it than meets the eye. Befriending frogs, skeletons, some tall goat lady, and others, Sora will have to give it his all in order to free the monsters of the underground from it's terrible curse. Or else be corrupted by an unknown threat to crave the need of EXP. And lots and lots of LoVe.

So I was thinking of a real time chat service where you could make a post and instantly start a chat with a group of people interested in the topic. Unlike forums you can get instant replies on your post and it will also be more like a discussion. Putting aside all the complexity involved in actually creating something like this, would you want to spend time having discussion about stuff you are interested in with random strangers on the internet?


Can this be a good real time chat service?

So we wouldn't be ashamed of our failures, because others have them too, and we wouldn't be having unrealistic standards for live. People would also stop looking down on others, because their failures are visible as well, it will bring mutual respect for the person or even genuine compassion. I don't know how we're going to do this, but I think less privacy on the internet would be, ironically, better. If we can just see the bad sides of someones life aswell, it would be beneficial in my opinion.

\[Further explanation\]

The unpopularopinion memes, websites, section and even the subreddit here is such a farce that always end up with obvious popular opinions been voted in mass while majority of voters think they are unpopular, when is clearly the opposite

And some things are even weekly brought to the top with 2k+ points each time

All this fake unpopular things end up just an echo chamber for a brainless bandwagon train that pushes on top the most popular things

**A true unpopular-opinion subreddit** should automatically freeze/shame a post and the users that upvoted it after reaches a certain amount of points/upvotes and build a karma bandwagon to tag all users that upvoted such obvious popular opinions, with no excuse given

&amp;#x200B;

Basically a mix system of how Black Mirror episodes of Nosedive and Hated in the Nation how ppl are exposed

And tag/expose users that bandwagon up vote popular opinions

The subreddit itself [https://np.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/](https://np.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/)  haves a similar rating tracking involved next to the user name(open a post and look at stars)

Then there are already bots in some subreddits that also auto tag users based on their post/comment history

The system is there but it seems ppl just prefer to keep the fake facade up there instead of doing a true social change/evolution to the current complacency

&amp;#x200B;

PS: just to give people a taste of current ""unpopular"" opinions i seen, here is the basic message in some top posts from last days.

""I like to be adult""

""Keep your kids silent in cinema""

""Emotion can influence your objective thought""

""GMO are ok""

""I like having adblock active""

etc..Just browse the subreddit by top and put an interval of time and will understand

Half of them even got gold and are on 10k+ points..

If people dont see the absurdity of that i dont know how else to explain it.

311,BIGDADDYBANDIT,t3_bkqq7x,2,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bkqq7x/reinstitute_article_xi_of_the_articles_of/,3,"So a crazy google rabbit whole lead to me learning that there are actual modern secessionist movements in Canada outside of Quebec and being a bit of a history nerd that reminded me of a clause in the now defunct Articles of Confederation (basically our rough draft of the Constitution) that reads:

*Canada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this union: but no other colony shall be admitted into the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine states.*


Now a few points and potential ramifications. I don't necessarily want Canada to break up and I know there is zero political will for something like this (otherwise I would be posting this somewhere else). But I am generally a proponent of local rule and letting the provinces that are not favored by the federal government have a political ""parachute"" in the form of guaranteed statehood would do much to give the more marginalized provinces leverage. Since Canada's supreme court ruled that secession is legal, so long as it is not unilateral and the result of a free and fair referendum, on paper it could work. I believe whatever was negotiated, it would probably end up before the Canadian supreme court, but the right of self-determination in this regard does seem to have been established.


I think new states would do much to shake up the political order in Washington, as the Canadian and American political spectrums do not cleanly line up and long term I think that is a good thing. Reconciling political and institutional differences would like have to include some devolution of powers from the federal government back to the states which would be good for all parties involved.


Economically the benefits would be manifest as trade barriers are completely eliminated and labor and capital are able to freely flow. I think a couple of provinces leaving would reduce the economic viability of the whole of Canada enough that most of if not all of the provinces join in time. One point of conflict I could think of is the economic concerns of Alberta having friction against the ecological concerns of British Columbia and without having to negotiate as two foreign powers Alberta could connect its natural gas from the shale fields to the U.S.'s network which is already the largest in the world (not to mention we have the largest petrochemical industry tooled for processing natural gas).


As for losing sovereignty, the solution I'd see that makes  the most sense is strengthening states rights to account for the wider range of differences in systems and cultures. I know for a fact that there are already states in the union far more politically and culturally different from my own than some of the provinces. There really isn't a clean cultural break along our border and while there may be differences in our identities on average, we are much more alike than we are different.",False,CrazyIdeas,Re-Institute Article XI of the Articles of Confederation (U.S.) and Allow Canadian Provinces to Freely Join the Union.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bkqq7x/reinstitute_article_xi_of_the_articles_of/

Communists/socialists living in first-world countries can sign up to be a part of the exchange program.  We contact socialist/communist governments and suggest that, instead of murdering dissidents and herding them into mass graves, they simply trade them for one of our citizens.  The communist/socialist country gets to look good because people from first-world countries want to live there, and they get to get rid of dissidents at the same time.  It's a win-win for them.

Once they agree, and a citizen from their country indicates their desire to trade places, the exchange would take place.  The person from the first-would country would surrender their bank accounts, their property, their car, and their possessions.  All of those things will be given to the new immigrant when they get here.  After all, all of those things are capitalist, and if they want to live under socialism/communism properly, they can't take that stuff with them.  But the incoming immigrant will be absolutely ecstatic to start off with some money and stuff.

We drop our citizen off at the airport in whatever country they've agreed to go to, have them renounce their citizenship (so they can't change their minds later), pick up the new immigrant, and head home.  That new immigrant gets everything the former citizen left behind, and are free to use it however they want to start their new life.  They're given a fast-track to citizenship, and we could even find a way to get companies to pledge to give jobs to immigrants who come here using this system.

This would result in socialists/communists living in socialist/communist countries, and capitalists living in capitalist countries.  There do not even have to be any limits on it whatsoever, since both countries would end up with the exact same number of inhabitants at the end of the process.  This would enable thousands more people living in these impoverished countries to make it to the first world than ever before, since they now have a whole new process they can use to immigrate.

I got this idea last summer and since nobody seems to do anything close to it I thought I should stop being a pussy and try to make it a reality.  
This money is coming from all the patrons who vote the winner from the subreddit's top 10 monthly posts.  
As a patron(we need those too but by the end of the month I'll raise a few bucks to donate myself so that the project can get a kickstart) there is no limit to how much you can pledge. All the money will be donated to the winner. Right now if you pledge you will get the access to a private discord server invite where the final voting process takes place, and where we can keep up and discuss the entries.  
You can find further information on https://www.patreon.com/VanityCharity.

513,zaiker,t3_bjkh7h,2,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bjkh7h/sonics_design_in_the_new_movie_is_terrible_on/,11,"   Sonic's new movie has made a bit of a turmoil in the internet community. Many people hate it. They hate everything about it. They hate Sonic's look, down to the fact that he has two eyes instead of one giant eyeball with two pupils (Really? That one is more realistic?). They hate everything about Dr. Robitnik (except for that clip in the end, he looked good there). They hate that military is involved, how so many video game movies take place in the real world as opposed to their own individual ones, and so on and so on.

   The point being, the Internet now hates Sonic as a character, because the thing we learned the most about the movie, is that we hate everything about Sonic. So how does *this* become a plot twist? 

THEORY BELOW/POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD

&gt;!Because you want Sonic dead. You want Sonic to die. You want him to fail. You want Robotnik to be the victor. But Sonic wins. Of course he wins. He destroys Dr. Robotnik's factory, the Doctor loses everything, Sonic is hailed as champion, blah blah blah, fade to black.!&lt;

&gt;!But wait. It's only been around 50 minutes in. We're only halfway through. What? How? Suddenly, we're back to the scene where Dr. Robotnik has Sonic surrounded on the building, presumably the final combat of that arc. Why this scene in particular? Because Dr. Robotnik is actually present for this combat, and wearing a rather interesting pair of goggles. Those goggles are also present in his wardrobe change at the end of the trailer. What if he were to crash sometime during this fight? What if there was a large fire, and a major portion of his unprotected face were to become burned and deformed? What if this fire completely burned his hair off, and frizzled his moustache? What if this was all a flashback, explaining Dr. Eggman's back story, and now both us the viewer and the character we're following have the same desires: to see Sonic destroyed. That's right: we are now following Dr. Eggman's story, and his quest for revenge. And we want him to win. He is now the protagonist, he looks like he should, and this movie is suddenly amazing.!&lt;",False,CrazyIdeas,"Sonic's design in the new movie is terrible on purpose, and will be the making of a great plot twist.

Fact: It can take 8 years for a drug to reach the market

That least 12 years during which a drug can be exclusively made by the holder of the patent.  After that, anyone can legally make the drug.

Almost all the drugs you see memes about where they complain about the price are no longer exclusive via patent.  Insulin costing $5,705 per year in the USA?  That's unjustifiable.  [Per BMJ, it may be possible to make effective insulin for as little as $72 per \*year\* per patient.](https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/5/e000850)   Even if we only got it down to $150/year/patient that'd be cheap enough to cover for free on any insurance policy.

Fact: Evergreening of drugs is a common occurrence - wherein a company makes a minor alteration to an existing drug that has an expiring patent to thereby grant a new 20 year patent, even if the new drug offers little to no health benefit over the old one (e.g. by adding a tiny amount of aspirin to it).

The invention of novel drugs that actually change the game is uncommon.  While there are cases where people do not get as much benefit from some generics as they do from the most recent patented drug, the majority could cost vastly less to medicate by using generics - and that number could go down even more if the state owned the manufacturer and supplied those drugs to its people as a non-profit citizen benefit.

Fact: not all expired patents create generic drugs.  Some medicines treat rare diseases and conditions.  If the market is too small, the generic manufacturers (which are sometimes the same company that makes the name brand drug) won't bother to produce it.  Capitalism doesn't support tiny markets well.  But a social program designed to benefit the populace could do so.   Deflazacort, for example, was too expensive to make when there's only about 15,000 patients in the USA.  So the US made an incentive by granting one company exclusive rights to make it and set a price of $89k/year for the drug.  Far better would be for the taxpayer to foot the bill of making that drug.  It is no longer patented.

When people talk about how expensive their health caare is in the USA, this is one of the major factors: drug prices.  The left likes to blame health insurance companies, but they don't make the drugs.  

I believe this crazy idea, which could be passed at the state level rather than having to go through Trump/Mitch, would be easier to pass than something like M4A,and  would let states dramatically lower the cost of health care for their people, whether they are insured or not, whether they are poor or not.

Procedure:

Have politicians wear uniforms once every quarter. 

Any politician receiving funds from an organization that is not publicly branded to the people on a uniform is punished.

Because hundreds of thousands of sponsorship organizations exist, these logos will be that of a symbol representing different types of sponsorship organization groups (coal, gas, pharma, tech).

Reminds a politician that their transparency to the public is demanded and that they are a civil servant.

however by growing trees, cutting them down and then putting preservatives in them before (not) letting them decay it will prevent the carbon cycle from continuing

this process should work the same way as shown in the carboniferous period, the creation of coal after a few thousand years may be a benefit but I don’t really find it helping much since hopefully we will be on renewables within the next hundred years if humans even survive that long

The game is set in Flat Zone, a big, expansive world featuring the landmarks from all the Game &amp; Watch games (like the gas station from Oil Panic, the farm from Egg, the fort from Fire Attack, ect). 

The story of the game is simple. It starts with Mr. Game &amp; Watch doing mundane tasks, and it seems like that's all there is. But later in the game, it gets more intense, ending with a battle between Mr. Game &amp; Watch and the giant octopus.

A fun mechanic could be that you play Game &amp; Watch games to solve problems. For example, a bridge is broken, and someone asks you to temporarily fix it by using a manhole cover. Then you have to play the Manhole Game &amp; Watch game.

Once you beat one of those Game &amp; Watch minigames, you unlock the ability to play as the protagonist from that game. So if you beat Manhole, you get to play as the guy from Manhole instead of Mr. Game &amp; Watch. It's just for looks, though.

This game also has every Game &amp; Watch game included in it. Go to Mr. Game &amp; Watch's house and you can play the ones you've unlocked.

923,throwaway_2837,t3_bhavjx,7,/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/bhavjx/build_a_20000_mile_railroad_track_that_snakes/,19,"Explore a new place every day, or at least see it out your window. The route is built to go somewhat near most major attractions in the U.S., like national parks, amusement/theme parks, etc. The more I think about this the more I want it to exist.

The train goes slightly slower through more scenic areas, and faster through the boring or unappealing spots. Residents vote on the train speed via a control panel in their house, but each train must maintain the 42 mile per week average so trains never get delayed by those ahead.

The track would have a road next to its full length so you could call an Uber/Lyft/taxi if you wanted to go somewhere, and for delivery services. Bikes or electric scooters are a great option too. Businesses would likely open along the train route to cater to travelers. At about 6 miles per 24 hours, the train is slow enough that you could even get a hotel for a night if you wanted and make your way back to the train the next day, or even spend a few days farther from the track. An app on your phone would always let you know the GPS coordinates of your train so it would be easy to find your way back, or let your guests know how to find you.

Specialty cars for everyone to enjoy can be added to your train for a few days, and then detached and wait for the next train: library, swimming pool, movie theater, arcade, gym. Enrichment classes (or even full schooling for children) could be offered by local residents who stay on the train for a few days before returning home.

Want to stay somewhere for a few weeks? Have your car pulled onto a siding and parked until you're ready to move on.

Rent is a cheaper for houses on longer trains, and more expensive for houses on shorter trains. The very wealthy can have their own train.

Due to not carrying freight and not going fast ever, the track and cars can be more cheaply constructed than a standard train. The major added expense would be adding bridges for almost every road crossing, since no one wants to wait hours for a train to pass; however as long as trains weren't too long drivers could just drive to the next crossing ahead or behind the train. With longer trains, there could even be special ""gap cars"" in the train that were connected at the top so people could drive through as if they were driving under a bridge. In high population density areas where land is expensive, the track could dip underground for several miles, and the train would move faster through the tunnels.

Growing family? Buy another car and put it next to yours. Or buy the car length that's just right for you. All cars are about 10 feet wide, so you can get the perfect length for the square footage you need. Since it would be a dedicated and purpose-built track, two or even three story houses could be built if all tunnels were constructed with high clearance.

A standard train car can carry about 100 tons, which is far more than would be needed for a simple home *unless OP's mom is staying there*. Due to the lower load requirements, the car surface could probably also be built much closer to the ground level for easier access.

Utilities would be provided by the train owner. Things like water and sewer might be charged based on usage since they're more expensive to provide when you're moving. Individual trains might be owned by different companies, which lease track space from the railroad based on their length. If your train's owner or neighbors bothered you for some reason, you could detach once your lease was up and wait for another train.

Detour tracks could exist too: if you want to go off the main route for a few months to see someplace new or skip an area you really don't want to visit, detach from your train to join the detour train, and rejoin your train once you complete the detour route. If the 20,000 mile track got ""full"" of trains, more miles could be added, or the route could be extended to Canada or Mexico.

At 42 miles per week, the route could be designed so that you don't have to spend too long in very cold or very hot weather. During things like hurricane or wildfire threats, all trains in that area could increase to a special evacuation speed of perhaps 10 mph.

I think this would be an awesome way to live.",False,CrazyIdeas,"Build a 20,000 mile railroad track that snakes around the U.S. in a giant loop. Add thousands of trains with flatbed cars.

As they get older, they adapt to change more slowly and embrace modernity less. They lose touch with modern problems of families and working age people, as well as become less capable of embracing modern solutions to those problems. 

This problem has only become compounded as technological advances have accelerated. In the late 1800, two decades or three decades brought relatively slow change to the average way of life for people. Contrast that to the changes between the 1980’s and today, where every aspect of life has been transformed. 

On top of that, the less life you have left, the less inclined you might be to worry about long term consequences of your actions, as they won’t affect you. If you’re going to be on this planet for another 50 years, you might be inclined to make sure it’s habitable. 

In order to help make sure our elected officials are people who are in touch with, and understand, the world of the age in which they’re living as opposed to one that no longer exists, I propose that all politicians be forced to retire on their 55th birthday.
